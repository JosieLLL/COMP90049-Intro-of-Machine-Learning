A loan will be granted if the classifier predicts an income of \">50K\", othewise it won't. The bank manager wants to avoid falsely granting a loan to an applicant with insufficient income by all means. Can you reassure the bank manager with the evaluation results in Q7 that your classifier is adequate? If not, describe an alternative evaluation metric and explain why it is more appropriate.\n",

    "**(d)** Do you observe a clear difference in performance between NB and Logistic Regression (LR) in Q7? Referring to the number of parameters and assumptions underlying each model, provide one reason why NB might outperform LR, and one reason why LR might outperform NB. In your answer, refer back to the *Adult* data set used in this assignment. **[1 mark]**\n",
    "\n",
    "**(e)** Assume that you have access to a (hypothetical) infinitely large U.S. census database (i.e., an enormous version of the *Adult* data set used in this assignment). Is it true that Logistic Regression, but not Naive Bayes, will achieve perfect test set performance? Why (not)? **[1 mark]**\n",
