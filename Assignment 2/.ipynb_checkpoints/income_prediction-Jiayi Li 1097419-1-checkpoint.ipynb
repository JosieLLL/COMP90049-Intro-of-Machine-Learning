You can use any Python built-in packages, but do not use any other 3rd party packages (the packages listed above are all fine to use); if your iPython notebook doesn't run on the marker's machine, you will lose marks. <b> You should use Python 3</b>.  \n",

    "<b>Evaluation</b>: Your iPython notebook should run end-to-end without any errors in a reasonable amount of time, and you must follow all instructions provided below, including specific implementation requirements and instructions for what needs to be printed (please avoid printing output we don't ask for). You should edit the sections below where requested, but leave the rest of the code as is. You should leave the output from running your code in the iPython notebook you submit, to assist with marking. The amount each section is worth is given in parenthesis after the instructions. \n",

While the main focus is on correctness of your methods, you will lose marks if your code is not understandable.\n",

However, this ultimately is still an individual task, and so reuse of code or other instances of clear influence will be considered cheating. We will be checking submissions for originality and will invoke the Universityâ€™s <a href=\"http://academichonesty.unimelb.edu.au/policy.html\">Academic Misconduct policy</a> where inappropriate levels of collusion or plagiarism are deemed to have taken place.\n"

    "High coefficient indicates higher likelihood for this feature to be related to the label classification. The categorical features \"capital-loss\" and \"Married-civ-spouse\" has been learned for largest coefficient. In Q3, \"Doctorate\" has been identified as the most relevant feature to predict the label. The two different results are from different methodologies that PMI is to investigate whether an attrbute is independent from the label, while Logistic Regression is aiming to minimize the loss function to maximize the performance of a feature's parameter so the feature is with the minimum error to predict the label."

    "**(c)** Assume that your best classifier will be deployed in a bank to decide whether a customer will be granted a loan, or not. A loan will be granted if the classifier predicts an income of \">50K\", othewise it won't. The bank manager wants to avoid falsely granting a loan to an applicant with insufficient income by all means. Can you reassure the bank manager with the evaluation results in Q7 that your classifier is adequate? If not, describe an alternative evaluation metric and explain why it is more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(d)** Do you observe a clear difference in performance between NB and Logistic Regression (LR) in Q7? Referring to the number of parameters and assumptions underlying each model, provide one reason why NB might outperform LR, and one reason why LR might outperform NB. In your answer, refer back to the *Adult* data set used in this assignment. **[1 mark]**\n",
    "\n",
    "**(e)** Assume that you have access to a (hypothetical) infinitely large U.S. census database (i.e., an enormous version of the *Adult* data set used in this assignment). Is it true that Logistic Regression, but not Naive Bayes, will achieve perfect test set performance? Why (not)? **[1 mark]**\n",

    "\n",
    "(a) The NB prediction based on the numerical data has higher accuracy, while the other two have higher f1 scores. Generally we would like to see better f1 score as it is a better balance of precision rate and recall rate. Therefore form this point of view, catogorical NB classifier and full data NB classifer performed best. If we only see the accuracy, then numerical NB classifier performed best. \n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Accuracy is calculated by the number of correctly labelled instances divided by the total number of test instances. F1 score is calculated by the average of precision rate and recall rate, which we both want to achineve higher. \n",
    "\n",
    "(c) If the three NB classifier are used, especially the numerical one, they would all perform adequate because they all have comparably high accuracy and f1 score. If the bank manager doesn't want to take the risk of loaning money to an unqualified applicant, then the numerical NB classifier, which has achieved 80% accuracy would be reasonalbe for the bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) One reason for NB outperform LR might be that it investigates the dependency between each feature and label by checking the probability that they would occur at the same, under the assumption each feature are internally indenpendent and also independent from the label. So if the joint probability is very high and leading to the high probability of the label given a feature, we could believe it is reliable to predict the label for that instance. By contrast, the LR iteratively optimizes the parameter by continously subtracting the error so the parameters(coefficients) would reach highest (which means the most related) to show the positive relationship between each feature and the label.\n",
    "\n",
    "(e) The large database provides larger training data for LR to optimize the parameters. So it could be performing better than NB."
